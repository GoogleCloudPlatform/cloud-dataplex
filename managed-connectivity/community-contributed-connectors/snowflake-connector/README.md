# Snowflake Connector

This custom connector extracts metadata from Snowflake databases into [BigQuery universal catalog](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/catalog-overview).

Custom connectors are part of the [Managed Connectivity framework](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/managed-connectivity-overview) and are responsible for the export of metadata from external systems into correctly formatted import files. Import of metadata files generated by this connector and building pipelines is covered below in the section [Import metadata into universal catalog](#import-metadata-into-universal-catalog).

See the documentation [Develop Custom Connectors](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/develop-custom-connector) for more information about custom connectors for universal catalog.

### Parameters
The Snowflake connector takes the following parameters:
|Parameter|Description|Default|Required/Optional|
|---------|------------|---|-------------|
|target_project_id|Google Cloud Project ID. Used in the generated metadata and defines the scope metadata will be imported into||REQUIRED|
|target_location_id|Google Cloud Region ID, or 'global'. Used in the generated metadata and indicates the region Entries will be associated with||REQUIRED|
|target_entry_group_id|Dataplex Entry Group ID the Entries will be associated with||REQUIRED|
|account|Snowflake account to connect to||REQUIRED|
|user|Snowflake username to connect with||REQUIRED|

|warehouse|Snowflake warehouse to connect to||OPTIONAL|
|local_output_only|Generate metadata in local directory only, do not push to cloud storage||OPTIONAL|
|output_bucket|Cloud Storage bucket where the output file will be stored.  Required if **--local_output_only** = False||REQUIRED|
|output_folder|Folder in the Cloud Storage bucket where the output metadata file will be stored.  Required if **--local_output_only** = False||
|min_expected_entries|Minimum number of entries expected in generated metadata file. If less file is not uploaded to Cloud Storage|-1|OPTIONAL|
### Prepare your Snowflake environment:

Best practise is to connect to the database using a dedicated user with the minimum privileges required to extract metadata. 

 The user for connecting should be granted a Security Role with the following privileges for the database and schemas, tables and views for which metadata needs to be extracted:
```sql
grant usage on warehouse <warehouse_name> to role <role_name>;
grant usage on database <database_name> to role <role_name>;
grant usage on all schemas in database <database_name> to role <role_name>;
grant references on all tables in schema <schema_name> to role <role_name>;
grant references on all views in schema <schema_name> to role <role_name>;
```

2. Add the password for the snowflake user to the Secret Manager in your project and note the Secret ID.

## Running the connector from the command line

The metadata connector can be run from the command line by executing the main.py script.

#### Prerequisites

The following tools must be installed in order to run the connector:

* Python 3.x. [See here for installation instructions](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/setup#installing_python)
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    ```bash
    sudo apt install default-jre
    ```
* A python Virtual Environment. Follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/setup#installing_and_using_virtualenv) to create and activate your environment.

* Install PySpark
    ```bash
    pip3 install pyspark
    ```
* You must run the script with a user that is authenticated to Google Cloud in order to access services there.  You can use [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login) for the connector to access Google APIs. 

(To use gcloud you may need to [install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install):

```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
```
The authenticated user must have the following roles for the project: roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor, roles/storage.objectUser

#### Set up
* Ensure you are in the root directory of the connector
    ```bash
    cd sql-server-connector
    ```

* Download the following jars [from Maven](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/)
    * [snowflake-jdbc-3.19.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc/3.19.0/)
    * [spark-snowflake_2.12-3.1.1.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/spark-snowflake_2.12/3.1.1/)

* Install all python dependencies 
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Run the connector
To execute the metadata extraction run the following, substituting appropriate values for your environment as needed:

```shell 
python3 main.py \
--target_project_id my-gcp-project \
--target_location_id us-central1 \
--target_entry_group_id snowflake \
--account RXXXXXA-GX00020 \
--user dataplex_snowflake_user \
--password-secret projects/499965349999/secrets/snowflake \
--database my_snowflake_database \
--warehouse COMPUTE_WH \
--output_bucket my-gcs-bucket
--output_folder snowflake
```

### Connector Output:
The connector generates a metadata extract file in JSONL format as described [in the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-metadata#metadata-import-file) and stores the file locally in the 'output' directory. The connector also uploads the file to the Google Cloud Storage bucket and folder specified in the **--output_bucket** and **--output_folder** parameters unless **--local-output_only** is used.

A sample output from the Snowflake connector can be found [here](sample/snowflake-output.jsonl).

## Import metadata into universal catalog

To manually import a metadata import file generated by this connector into universal catalog see the documentation [Import metadata using a custom pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-metadata#import-metadata) for instructions on calling the API and considerations when importing custom metadata. The [samples](/samples) directory in this connector contains a sample metadata file and request file you can use to import into the catalog.

To create an end-to-end pipeline which runs metadata extraction using the connector and then submits an Import API job to bring the generated file into universal catalog, see the section below:  [Create an end-to-end metadata extraction and import pipeline to universal catalog](#create-an-end-to-end-metadata-extraction-and-import-pipeline-to-universal-catalog)



## Build a container and running the connector using Dataproc Serverless

Building a Docker container for the connector allows it to be run from a variety of Google Cloud services including [Dataproc Serverless](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs).

### Building the container (one-time task)

1. Ensure docker is installed in your environment.
2. Edit [build_and_push_docker.sh](build_and_push_docker.sh) and set the PROJECT_ID AND REGION_ID
3. Ensure the user that runs the script is authenticated with a Google Cloud identify which has (Artifact Registry Writer)[https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles] role on the Artfiact Registry in your project.
4. Make the script executable and run:
    ```bash
    chmod a+x build_and_push_docker.sh
    ./build_and_push_docker.sh
    ``` 

    This will build a Docker container called **bq-catalog-sqlserver-pyspark** and store it in Artifact Registry. 
    This process can take take up to 10 minutes.

### Submitting a metadata extraction job to Dataproc Serverless:

Before you run please ensure:
1. You upload the jdbc jar file to a Google Cloud Storage location and use the path to this in the **--jars** parameter below.
2. Create a GCS bucket which will be used for Dataproc Serverless as a working directory (add to the **--deps-bucket** parameter below.
3. The service account you run the job with using **--service-account** below has the IAM roles described [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-using-workflows-custom-source#required-roles).
You can use this [script](../common_scripts/grant_SA_dataproc_roles.sh) to grant the required roles to your service account.

Run the containerised metadata connector using the following command, substituting appropriate values for your environment: 

```shell
gcloud dataproc batches submit pyspark \
    --project=my-gcp-project-id \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --batch=0001 \
    --deps-bucket=dataplex-metadata-collection-bucket \  
    --container-image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-gcp-project-id/docker-repo/snowflake-pyspark@sha256:dab02ca02f60a9e12769999191b06d859b947d89490d636a34fc734d4a0b6d08 \
    --service-account=440199992669-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --network=Your-Network-Name \
    main.py \
    --target_project_id my-gcp-project \
    --target_location_id us-central1 \
    --target_entry_group_id snowflake \
    --account RXXXXXA-GX00020 \
    --user snowflakeuser \
    --password-secret projects/499965349999/secrets/snowflake \
    --database SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA \
    --output_bucket my-gcs-bucket
```

Note:
* If you need to use a different version of the JDBC jar you can store it in a Cloud Storage bucket and give the bucket path **--jar** parameter (ie --jars=gs://path/to/jar/mssql-jdbc-other.jar)

See the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/batches/submit/pyspark) for more information about Dataproc Serverless pyspark jobs.

## Create an end-to-end metadata extraction and import pipeline to universal catalog

An end-to-end metadata extraction and import pipeline with monitoring can be created using [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows) and scheduled to run on a regular basis.

Follow the documentation here: [Import metadata from a custom source using Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-using-workflows-custom-source) and use [this yaml file](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-dataplex/blob/main/managed-connectivity/cloud-workflows/byo-connector/templates/byo-connector.yaml) as a template.
