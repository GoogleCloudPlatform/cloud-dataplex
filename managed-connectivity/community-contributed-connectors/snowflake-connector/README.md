# Snowflake Connector

This custom connector extracts metadata from Snowflake databases into [Dataplex Universal Catalog](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/introduction).

Custom connectors are part of the [Managed Connectivity framework](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/managed-connectivity-overview) and are responsible for the export of metadata from external systems into correctly formatted import files. Import of metadata files generated by this connector and building pipelines is covered below in the section [Import metadata into universal catalog](#import-metadata-into-universal-catalog). See the documentation [Develop a custom connector for metadata import](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/develop-custom-connector) for more information about custom connectors for universal catalog.

This is not an officially supported Google product and is provided on an as-is basis, without warranty. This project is not eligible for the [Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards
Program](https://bughunters.google.com/open-source-security).

### Target objects and schemas:

Metadata for the following database objects is extracted by the connector:
|Object|Metadata Extracted|
|---------|------------|
|Tables|Table name, column names, column data types, column NULL/NOT NULL|
|Views|View name, column names, column data types, column NULL/NOT NULL|

Metadata is not extracted for objects in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

### Parameters
The connector takes the following parameters:

|Parameter|Description|Default|Required/Optional|
|---------|------------|---|-------------|
|target_project_id|Google Cloud Project ID. Used in the generated metadata and defines the scope metadata will be imported into||REQUIRED|
|target_location_id|Google Cloud Region ID, or 'global'. Used in the generated metadata and indicates the region Entries will be associated with||REQUIRED|
|target_entry_group_id|Entry Group ID which the Entries will be associated with||REQUIRED|
|account|Snowflake account to connect to||REQUIRED|
|user|Snowflake username to connect with||REQUIRED|
|authentication|Authentication method to use: password, oauth|password|OPTIONAL|
|password_secret|Google Secret Manager ID holding the password for the Snowflake user. Format: projects/{project-number}/secrets/{secret-name}||REQUIRED if using password auth|
|token|OAUTH Token||REQUIRED if using **--authentication oauth**|
|database|Snowflake database to connect to||REQUIRED|
|warehouse|Snowflake warehouse to connect to||OPTIONAL|
|local_output_only|Generate metadata import file in local directory only, do not push to Cloud Storage|False|OPTIONAL|
|output_bucket|Cloud Storage bucket where the output file will be stored.  Required if **--local_output_only False**||REQUIRED|
|output_folder|Folder in Cloud Storage bucket where the output metadata import file will be stored. Required if **--local_output_only False**||
|min_expected_entries|Minimum number of entries expected in generated metadata import file. If less file is not uploaded to Cloud Storage|-1|OPTIONAL|

Note: **target_project_id**, **target_location_id** and **target_entry_group_id** are used as string values in the generated metadata import file only and do not need to match the project where the connector is being run. These three values define the job scope used when importing the metadata into the catalog, see [components of a metadata job](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-metadata#components) for details.

## Create a database user

Best practice is to create a dedicated database user for the connector with the minimum privileges required to extract metadata.

The Snowflake user should be granted a [role](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview#roles) with usage and reference privileges for the database, schemas, tables, and views for which metadata will be extracted
```sql
grant usage on warehouse <warehouse_name> to role <role_name>;
grant usage on database <database_name> to role <role_name>;
grant usage on all schemas in database <database_name> to role <role_name>;
grant references on all tables in schema <schema_name> to role <role_name>;
grant references on all views in schema <schema_name> to role <role_name>;
```

2. Add the password for the user to the Secret Manager in your Google Cloud project and note the ID (format is: projects/{project-number}/secrets/{secret-name})

## Install the connector

Follow these instructions to install and set up the connector to run directly from the command line.

### Prerequisites

The following tools and libraries are required to run the connector:

* Python 3.x. Installation on Linux:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip
    ```
* Python Virtual Environment. Create the environment and activate:
    ```shell
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

    Also run ```source env/bin/activate``` each time before you use the connector in future.

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    ```shell
    sudo apt install default-jre
    ```
* Install PySpark
    ```shell
    pip3 install pyspark
    ```

Note: If you are not running the connector in a Google Cloud managed environment then you need to first install the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)

#### Set-up
* Clone repository to local machine
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-dataplex.git
    ```
* Ensure you are in the root directory of the connector
    ```bash
    cd cloud-dataplex/managed-connectivity/community-contributed-connectors/snowflake-connector
    ```

* Download the following Snowflake jar files [from Maven](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/)
    * [snowflake-jdbc-3.19.0.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc/3.19.0/)
    * [spark-snowflake_2.12-3.1.1.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/spark-snowflake_2.12/3.1.1/)
    ```bash
    wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/snowflake-jdbc/3.19.0/snowflake-jdbc-3.19.0.jar
    wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/snowflake/spark-snowflake_2.12/3.1.1/spark-snowflake_2.12-3.1.1.jar
    ```

* Install python dependencies 
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Authentication and Authorization for the connector in Google Cloud
Before running the connector from the command line, ensure your session user is authenticated as a Google Cloud identity that has been granted read access to Secret Manager and read/write to Cloud Storage in the current project.  The user requires the following IAM roles in the project where the connector runs:

* roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
* roles/storage.objectUser

You can use [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login) to ensure the session is authenticated

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Note: If you are not running the connector in a Google Cloud managed environment then you need to first install the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)

## Run the connector from the command line

Run the following command from the root directory of the connector, substituting appropriate values and parameters for your environment as needed:

```shell 
python3 main.py \
--target_project_id gcp-project-id \
--target_location_id us-central1 \
--target_entry_group_id snowflake \
--account RXXXXXA-GX00020 \
--user dataplex_snowflake_user \
--password_secret projects/gcp-project-number/secrets/snowflake \
--database MY_SNOWFLAKE_DB \
--warehouse COMPUTE_WH \
--output_bucket my-gcs-bucket
--output_folder snowflake
```

## Connector Output:
The connector generates a metadata import file in JSONL format as described [in the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-metadata#metadata-import-file) and stores the file locally in the 'output' directory. The connector also uploads the file to the Google Cloud Storage bucket and folder specified in the **--output_bucket** and **--output_folder** parameters unless **--local-output_only True** is used.

A sample output from the Snowflake connector can be found in the [sample](sample/) directory.

## Import metadata into Dataplex Universal Catalog

To manually import a metadata import file generated by this connector into universal catalog see [Import metadata using a custom pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-metadata#import-metadata) for instructions on calling the API and considerations when importing custom metadata. 

Before importing metadata, the Entry Group and all Entry Types and Aspect Types found in the metadata file must exist in Dataplex for the target project and location (either a Google Cloud region, or 'global'). This connector requires the following Entry Group, Entry Types and Aspect Types:

|Catalog Object|IDs required by connector|
|---------|-------------------|
Entry Group|Defined in **--target_entry_group_id** when metadata is extracted|
Entry Type|**snowflake-account**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-database**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-schema**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-table**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-view**|  
Aspect Type|**snowflake-account**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-database**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-schema**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-table**&nbsp;&nbsp;**snowflake-view**| 

See [manage entries and create custom sources](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources) for instructions on creating Entry Groups, Entry Types, and Aspect Types.

To create an end-to-end pipeline which extracts metadata and starts an Import API job to bring the generated file into universal catalog, see section [Create an end-to-end metadata extraction and import pipeline to Dataplex Universal Catalog](#create-an-end-to-end-metadata-extraction-and-import-pipeline-to-dataplex-universal-catalog)

## Build a container and run the connector with Dataproc Serverless

Follow these instructions to build a Docker container which allows the connector to be run with [Dataproc Serverless](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-serverless/docs).

### Build the container (one-time task)

1. Ensure docker is installed in your environment.
2. Edit [build_and_push_docker.sh](build_and_push_docker.sh) and set the PROJECT_ID AND REGION_ID
3. Ensure the user that runs the script is authenticated with a Google Cloud identify which has (Artifact Registry Writer)[https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles] role on the Artfiact Registry in your project.
4. Make the script executable and run:
    ```bash
    chmod a+x build_and_push_docker.sh
    ./build_and_push_docker.sh
    ``` 

    This will build a Docker container called **catalog-snowflake-pyspark** and store it in Artifact Registry. This process can take take up to 5 minutes.

### Run a metadata extraction job with Dataproc Serverless

#### Set-up

Before you submit a job to Dataproc Serverless:

1. Create or choose a Cloud Storage bucket to be used as a working directory for Dataproc. Use the path for the **--deps-bucket** parameter below.
2. The service account given in **--service-account** below must have the IAM roles described [here](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-using-workflows-custom-source#required-roles) to successfully run Dataproc. You can use this [script](../common_scripts/grant_SA_dataproc_roles.sh) to grant the required roles to your service account.

Note:
* If **--service-account** is not provided then the default Compute Service Account for the project will be assumed.

#### Submit a Dataproc Serverless job

* Ensure you are in the root directory of the connector
    ```bash
    cd snowflake-connector
    ```

Run the following command, substituting appropriate values for your environment and provding a unique batch ID in **--batch**

```shell
gcloud dataproc batches submit pyspark \
    --project=gcp-project-id \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --batch=snowflake-metadata-001 \
    --deps-bucket=dataplex-metadata-collection-bucket \  
    --container-image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-project-id/docker-repo/catalog-snowflake-pyspark:latest \
    --service-account=gcp-project-number-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --jars=spark-snowflake_2.12-3.1.1.jar,snowflake-jdbc-3.19.0.jar \
    --version=1.2 \
    --network=default \
    main.py \
    --target_project_id my-gcp-project \
    --target_location_id us-central1 \
    --target_entry_group_id snowflake \
    --account RXXXXXA-GX00020 \
    --user snowflakeuser \
    --password_secret projects/gcp-project-number/secrets/snowflake \
    --database MY_SNOWFLAKE_DB \
    --output_bucket my-gcs-bucket
    --output_folder snowflake_metadata
```
Note: Due to the use of the Snowflake Spark JAR in the connector, runtime version 1.2 of Dataproc serverless must be specified for this connector.

See the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/dataproc/batches/submit/pyspark) for more information about Dataproc Serverless pyspark jobs.

## Create an end-to-end metadata extraction and import pipeline to Dataplex Universal Catalog

An end-to-end metadata extraction and import pipeline with monitoring can be created using [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows) and scheduled to run on a regular basis.

Follow the documentation here: [Import metadata from a custom source using Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/import-using-workflows-custom-source) and use [this yaml file](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-dataplex/blob/main/managed-connectivity/cloud-workflows/byo-connector/templates/byo-connector.yaml) as a template.

An example of input parameters for creating an import job with Workflows can be found in the [workflows](workflows/) directory.
