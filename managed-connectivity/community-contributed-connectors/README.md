# Custom metadata connectors 

These connectors extract metadata from third-party systems. You use the connector when running a managed connectivity pipeline to import extracted metadata into [BigQuery universal catalog](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/catalog-overview).

They are based on the sample connector code found in [sample-custom-connector](../sample-custom-connector) and use python and pyspark.
