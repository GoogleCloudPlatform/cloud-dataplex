# Google Cloud Dataplex - Managed Connectivity

Managed connectivity lets you import metadata into Dataplex at scale. A managed connectivity pipeline extracts metadata from your data sources and then imports the metadata into Dataplex. Refer to our official guide at [Managed connectivity overview](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/managed-connectivity-overview) for more details.
