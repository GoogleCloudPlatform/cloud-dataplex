# Orchestration for Dataplex Managed Connectivity

Dataplex Managed Connectivity platform provides customers a self-service experience to connect and ingest metadata from non-GCP sources into Dataplex Catalog.

This guide demonstrates how to self orchestrate the flow for Managed Connectivity. Self orchestration is achieved through a Cloud Workflow which performs the following high level steps:

1. Create target EntryGroup, if it does not exist, based on user configuration.
2. Metadata Extraction: Create Dataproc serverless batch job for connector run. 
3. Monitor the progress of the batch job.
4. Metadata Import: Trigger Dataplex Metadata Import job upon successful completion of the batch job.
5. Monitor the progress of the Import job.

## User Guide
### Deployment and Execution

#### Console
Go to [Cloud Workflows](https://console.cloud.google.com/workflows) to setup a new workflow.

1. To create a new Cloud Workflow, select CREATE

<img alt="create workflow" src="images/create_workflow.png" width="600">

2. Define workflow using one of the sample template provided, example [bring your own connector template](byo-connector/templates/byo-connector.yaml)

<img alt="add template" src="images/add_template.png" width="600">

3. To manually run your workflow, select your workflow and select EXECUTE

<img alt="run manually" src="images/run_manually.png" width="600">

4. Provide your Workflow arguments in the form of json (example [bring your own connector arguments](byo-connector/args/byo-connector-workflow-args.json)).

<img alt="provide args" src="images/provide_args.png" width="600">

5. To schedule your Cloud Workflow, use [Cloud Scheduler](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler) and select CREATE JOB. Provide Scheduler Job definition and Frequency via cron expression, as well as timezone.

<img alt="schedule workflow" src="images/schedule_workflow.png" width="600">

6. Select Target type Workflows via HTTP, your Cloud Workflow, and your Service Account. Additionally, provide your workflow arguments as well.

7. Provide any additional optional retry logic.

### gcloud
Another way to deploy the resources is through gcloud.
1. Deploy the Workflow Template and Cloud Scheduler Job using [these commands](samples/scripts/gcloud/deploy.sh).

2. Execute the Workflow Template with your desired arguments using commands in [this script](samples/scripts/gcloud/execute.sh).

#### Terraform
Refer to sample code for supplementary information.

Clone repository.
```bash
git clone <repository_url> # Replace with the actual repository URL
```
1. Choose connector and update configuration. Example [bring your own connector config](byo-connector/terraform/byo-connector.tfvars).
2. Initialize, validate, and deploy terraform with the desired terraform variables file.
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan --var-file=byo-connector.tfvars
terraform apply --var-file=byo-connector.tfvars
```
Terraform will create the following resources in the specified Google Cloud project:
1. [Cloud Scheduler](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler) job
2. [Cloud Workflow](https://console.cloud.google.com/workflows)

Cloud Workflows will execute at the **cron_schedule** that you specify.

### Monitoring
#### Workflow output
The workflow templates emit 2 important links for monitoring in the LOGS tab in the executions UI:
1. Link to the Dataproc Serverless Batch job for metadata extraction
2. Link to Cloud logs for Dataplex Metadata Import job.
#### Import job logs in Logs Explorer
Navigate to [Cloud Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs) to observe logs. Filter logs by Metadata Job monitored resource.
```
resource.type="dataplex.googleapis.com/MetadataJob"
resource.labels.location=${region}
resource.labels.metadata_job_id=${import_job_id}
```
#### Import job logs using gcloud
```bash
gcloud --project ${project_id} logging read "resource.type=dataplex.googleapis.com/MetadataJob AND
resource.labels.location=${region} AND 
resource.labels.metadata_job_id=${import_job_id}" --freshness=7d
```
