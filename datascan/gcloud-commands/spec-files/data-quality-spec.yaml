# DataQualityScan related setting. Variable descriptions are provided in https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/reference/rest/v1/DataQualitySpec.
# A datascan can specify only one of data_profile_spec or data_quality_spec, but not both.
data_quality_spec:
  # [Optional] The percentage of the records to be selected from the dataset for DataScan.
  # If present, this variable will override the variable provided in datascan_defaults.
  sampling_percent: 100

  # [Optional]  A filter applied to all rows in a single DataScan job. The filter needs to be a valid SQL expression for a WHERE clause in BigQuery standard SQL syntax. Example: col1 >= 0 AND col2 < 10
  # If present, this variable will override the variable provided in datascan_defaults.
  row_filter: "station_id > 1000"

  # [Optional]  The configuration of BigQuery export post scan action upon job completion.
  # post_scan_actions:
  #   bigquery_export:
  #     results_table: "//bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/{project_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/tables/{export_table}"

  # DataQualityScan rule configurations. Documentation for the supported rule types and rule specifications can be found in https://cloud.example.com/dataplex/docs/reference/rest/v1/DataQualityRule.
  # Can optionally reference templated rules provided in the variable datascan_rules_library_file_path. Any variables provided here will override the default values provided in the rules library file.
